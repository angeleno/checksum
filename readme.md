Handy utility to compute checksum for a given file, just ensure that file is not in use.
Can be easily upgraded to account for directories and export to csv/excel.

Checksum supported are:
```
- CRC32
- MD5
- SHA1
- SHA256
- SHA384
- SHA512
```

By default `CRC32`, `MD5` and `SHA1` are enabled, remaining ones you can check on.
